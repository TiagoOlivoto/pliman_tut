# Overview

{pliman} (**pl**ant **im**age **an**alysis) is designed (but not limited) to analyze plant images, especially related to leaf and seed analysis. The package will help you to:

-   Measure the severity of foliar diseases;
-   Count the number of injuries;
-   Obtain characteristics of the shape of the lesions;
-   Count objects in an image;
-   Obtain characteristics of objects (area, perimeter, radius, circularity, eccentricity, solidity, elongation);
-   Get the RGB values for each object in an image;
-   Get the coordinates of objects;
-   Get the outlines of objects;
-   Get the *convex hull*;
-   Isolate objects;
-   Plot object measurements.

# Instalation

Install the released version of pliman from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=pliman) with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages ("pliman")
```

Or install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/TiagoOlivoto/pliman)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# instalação do github
if(!require(devtools)){
  install.packages("devtools")
}

install_github("TiagoOlivoto/pliman")

# Para instalar a vinheta HTML, use
devtools::install_github("TiagoOlivoto/pliman", build_vignettes = TRUE)

```

*Note*: If you are a Windows user, it is suggested to first download and install the latest version of [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/). For the latest release notes on this development version, see the [NEWS file](https://tiagoolivoto.github.io/metan/news/index.html).

# Useful packages

The results generated by the `pliman` package are returned as `data.frame` objects, which allows future manipulation within R. Therefore, it is suggested that the following packages be installed.

```{r warning=FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)  # data manipulation
library(metan)      # descriptive statistics / arrange graphics
library(pliman)     # image analysis
```

# How to reproduce

First, donwload the `.zip` file that contains the static website.

<a href="https://github.com/TiagoOlivoto/pliman_tut/archive/refs/heads/master.zip"> <button class="btn btn-success"><i class="fa fa-save"></i> Download the images and scripts</button> </a>

The folder `img` has the following structure.

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(fs)
fs::dir_tree("E:/Desktop/UFSC/cursos/pliman_tut/imgs", recurse = 1)
```

The html material (`_site/index.html`) will give access to the site. Within it, it will be possible to visualize all the examples, with codes and outputs. To reproduce the material, just use the `*.qmd` files.

For rendering, it is suggested that the folder `imgs` be set as the default directory. In my case, I set the directory using the following command.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# change according to your folder
setwd("E:/Desktop/UFSC/cursos/pliman_tut/imgs")
```

# Slides

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_url('https://tiagoolivoto.github.io/slides_R/slides/pliman_tut')

```
